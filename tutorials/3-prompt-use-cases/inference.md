## Inference and Analysis

Inference involves drawing conclusions or making predictions based on available information. In software development, this can range from code analysis to architectural decision-making.

### Applications of Inference

- Identifying potential bugs or security vulnerabilities
- Predicting performance bottlenecks
- Analysing code complexity and maintainability
- Determining appropriate design patterns
- Evaluating architectural decisions
